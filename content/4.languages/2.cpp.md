::alert{type="info"}
Some systems are not yet supported by Necto modules for C++ due to header implementation issues provided by the systems. For more info, please visit the [modules](https://necto.dev/modules) page and see if the system is supported. A GitHub issue will also be created to track the progress of the implementations for the specific systems.

::drop-down{title="Install via Corinvo CLI"}
Necto can be installed and set up easily using the [`corinvo` CLI](https://cli.corinvo.dev) tool. The CLI tool is a powerful utility that allows you to manage everything related to Corinvo tools and services, including Necto.

```shellscript [terminal]
corinvo tools necto init --lang="<cpp or c++>" --project-name="<project name>" --modules="<desired modules to pre-install>"
```

Bellow are other CLI options that you can pass in to further specify how Necto is configured for your project.

### CLI Options
 
| --Option--          | --Description--                                                        |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--cpp-version` | Version of C++ to use (e.g. "c++11", "c++14", "c++17", "c++20", "latest")    |
| `--cpp-compiler` | C++ compiler to use (e.g. "gcc", "clang", "msvc")                  |
| `--cpp-std`     | C++ standard to use (e.g. "c++11", "c++14", "c++17", "c++20")      |
| `--cpp-flags`    | Additional C++ compiler flags to use (e.g. "-std=c++11", "-Wall", "-Werror") |
| `--cpp-lib`      | Library to link against (e.g. "stdc++", "libc++")                  |
| `--cpp-include`  | Additional include directories to use (e.g. "-I/usr/include", "-I/usr/local/include") |
| `--cpp-lib-path` | Library path to use (e.g. "-L/usr/lib", "-L/usr/local/lib")        |
| `--cpp-builder`  | The build tools used to build C++ code (e.g. "cmake", "make", "bazel", "meson", "ninja"). The default is set to CMake and will create a CMakeLists.txt |
| `--template`     | Template to use for the project (e.g. "blank", "consoleapp", "lib") |
| `--project-path`  | Path to the project directory (e.g. ./, ./developer)               |


Additionally, you can also pass in a path following the init command, like this: `corinvo tools necto init <path> (e.g. ./, ./developer)`, to specify where the initialized C++ project should be created.

If you already have a C++ project and wish to add Necto to the project using the Corinvo CLI, simply specify the path to the project directory as an argument to the init command. The CLI will automatically detect that it is an already existing project. It may ask a few questions based on your current project configuration using the built-in TUI.
::

C++ is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that enables developers to create high-performance, efficient, and versatile software systems. It combines the low-level control of C with object-oriented, generic, and functional programming features, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from system-level programming to large-scale software development.

C++ is widely used in developing resource-intensive applications, such as video games, operating systems, and embedded systems, as well as performance-critical software like financial trading platforms, scientific simulations, and graphics engines. Its extensive standard library, strong type checking, and direct hardware access make it a go-to language for projects requiring both speed and flexibility.
