::drop-down{title="Install via Corinvo CLI"}
Necto can be installed and set up easily using the [`corinvo` CLI](https://cli.corinvo.dev) tool. The CLI tool is a powerful utility that allows you to manage everything related to Corinvo, including Necto.

```shellscript [terminal]
corinvo tools necto init --lang="ruby" --modules="<desired modules to pre-install>"
```

After the command runs, it will ask a few questions of how to configure the project. It will ask if you wish to install lint or typechecking tools such as Sorbet or Rubocop. It will also suggest Necto utilities that are available for those tools (if there are any).

Bellow are the CLI options that you can pass in to further specify how Necto is configured for your project. If you pass in all of the optional commands, the interactive configuration prompt may be bypassed. If you are running the Corinvo CLI in the CI or CD environment, please refer to [this](https://docs.corinvo.dev/cli/ci-cd) documentation to optimize performance. 

### CLI Options
 
| Type   | Command     | Description |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |

| Arg    | `[path]`    | Optional path to initialize project |
| Option | `--lang <lang>` | Specify language (e.g. Ruby, Python), only one lang may be provided |
| Option | `--modules <module1, module2>` | Specify modules to include (e.g. math, json) |
