Go is an open-source programming language that enables developers to build fast, scalable, and concurrent systems. It provides a clean and minimalist design, making it easy to write, test, and maintain code that integrates with various libraries, frameworks, and services.

Go is widely used to build binary applications, such as command-line tools and system daemons, as well as large-scale cloud infrastructure and distributed systems, like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and other cloud-native applications.

## Get started with Go and Necto

Prerequisites for getting started with Go and Necto:
- If you are using Corinvo CLI, you should have that installed. If not, you can install it by following this [guide](https://cli.corinvo.dev/install).
- If using Go directly, you should have Go installed on your system. You can download and install Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl). 

::drop-down{title="Install via Corinvo CLI"}
Necto can be installed and set up easily using the [`corinvo` CLI](https://cli.corinvo.dev) tool. The CLI tool is a powerful utility that allows you to manage everything related to Corinvo tools and services, including Necto.

```shellscript [terminal]
corinvo tools necto init --lang="go" --go-version="<version>" --module-name="<module name>" --modules="<desired modules to pre-install>"
```

Bellow are other CLI options that you can pass in to further specify how Necto is configured for your project.

### CLI Options
 
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--go-version` | Version of Go to use (e.g. "1.19", "1.20", "latest") |
| `--module-url` | Module path in Go.mod format (e.g. "github.com/user/repo") |
| `--go-os` | Operating system to target (e.g. "linux", "darwin", "windows") |
| `--go-arch` | Architecture to target (e.g. "amd64", "arm64", "arm") |
| `--go-gopath` | GOPATH to use for the project |
| `--go-env` | Environment variables to set for the Go installation (e.g. GOPROXY, GONOPROXY, GOPRIVATE) |
| `--template` | Template to use for the project (e.g. "blank", "webapp", "lib"), this may also create Makefiles |

Additionally, you can also pass in a path following the init command, like this: `corinvo tools necto init <path> (e.g. ./, ./developer)`, to specify where the initialized Go project should be created.

If you already have a Go project and wish to add Necto to the project using the Corinvo CLI, simply specify the path to the project directory as an argument to the init command. The CLI will automatically detect that it is an already existing project. It may ask a few questions based on your current project configuration using the built-in TUI.

### Install using Go directly

Installing Necto using go directly is simple. Necto provides a custom vanity URL system that allows you to install Necto using the `go get` command.

```shellscript [terminal] vscode-icons:file-type-go-package
go get go.necto.dev
``
