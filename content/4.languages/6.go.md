::drop-down{title="Install via Corinvo CLI"}
Necto can be installed and set up easily using the [`corinvo` CLI](https://cli.corinvo.dev) tool. The CLI tool is a powerful utility that allows you to manage everything related to Corinvo tools and services, including Necto.

```shellscript [terminal]
corinvo tools necto init --lang="go" --go-version="<version>" --module-name="<module name>" --modules="<desired modules to pre-install>"
```

Bellow are other CLI options that you can pass in to further specify how Necto is configured for your project.

### CLI Options
 
| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--go-version` | Version of Go to use (e.g. "1.19", "1.20", "latest") |
| `--module-url` | Module path in Go.mod format (e.g. "github.com/user/repo") |
| `--go-os` | Operating system to target (e.g. "linux", "darwin", "windows") |
| `--go-arch` | Architecture to target (e.g. "amd64", "arm64", "arm") |
| `--go-gopath` | GOPATH to use for the project |
| `--go-env` | Environment variables to set for the Go installation (e.g. GOPROXY, GONOPROXY, GOPRIVATE) |
| `--template` | Template to use for the project (e.g. "blank", "webapp", "lib"), this may also create Makefiles |

Additionally, you can also pass in a path following the init command, like this: `corinvo tools necto init <path> (e.g. ./, ./developer)`, to specify where the initialized Go project should be created.

If you already have a Go project and wish to add Necto to the project using the Corinvo CLI, simply specify the path to the project directory as an argument to the init command. The CLI will automatically detect that it is an already existing project. It may ask a few questions based on your current project configuration using the built-in TUI.
