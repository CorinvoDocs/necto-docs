## What is Necto? 
 
Necto is a utility service that provides tools to help you build and scale powerful applications. You write your application code and we'll deal with the rest.

Under the hood, Necto optimizes low-level infrastructure to make your everyday programming faster. Necto also exposes low-level systems API to allow you to build what you want with no restrictions. 

## The programmers dream  
    
Programmers want to focus on building their applications and bring their ideas to life and not to deal with writing new modules that they will only use once.

Necto offers a single solution to a variety of problems.
