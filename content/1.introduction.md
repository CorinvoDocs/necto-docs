## What is Necto? 

Necto is an innovative, open-source utility layer that redefines the approach to common programming tasks and system-level operations across multiple languages and platforms. 
It offers a cohesive ecosystem that unifies utilities for different programming languages, frameworks, and operating systems into one solution.

## The dependency problem

In modern software development, projects often rely on numerous third-party dependencies to implement various functionalities. While these dependencies can speed up development, they also introduce several challenges. Managing multiple libraries with conflicting versions can lead to compatibility issues, while poorly optimized or bloated libraries can significantly impact application performance. The overhead of integrating and maintaining multiple dependencies adds additional complexity to projects. Additionally, bugs or vulnerabilities in third-party code can compromise entire systems or render applications unusable. Moreover, using different libraries for similar functions across languages leads to fragmented codebases and inconsistent development workflows.

## Necto, solution for the modern era

The last dependency you'll ever need!
(Disclaimer: We're joking, but only a little.)

Necto provides a comprehensive, unified solution packed full with features that you no longer need to implement yourself. It replaces multiple third-party libraries with a single, well-maintained utility layer and even improved language specific implementations. Dependency conflicts and version management issues are now the issue of the past. By implementing core functionalities uniformly across different programming languages, Necto eliminates the need for language-specific libraries and promotes code reusability. Each package in Necto is optimized for its specific use case and language, ensuring better performance compared to generic, one-size-fits-all libraries. With fewer external dependencies, applications built with Necto have a smaller attack surface, enhancing overall system security. Necto is designed to work seamlessly with all of your existing development tools and frameworks, allowing for easy adoption.
